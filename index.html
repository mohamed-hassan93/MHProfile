        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>Nothing to really see here as of yet since I only just finished learning CSS. Ultimately the goal is to get really good at web development so I can branch off into working in technology. Ideally in a start-up atmosphere where I dont have
          to wear a dress shirt. Hopefully this works out.</p>

        <h3>Chemical Engineering</h3>
        <p>Chemical Engineer by trade. I've worked in the field long enough to know that it isn't what I want to do full time, leading me to learn about web development. I'm finding my engineering experience being extremely helpful in developping my coding skills, as concepts such as ladder logic, data analysis and troubleshooting has helped so far in the learning process.</p>
